# Integrations

Integrations allow establishing interaction between Forge and external services, such as GitHub and GitLab.

Using integration, you can trigger a specific template by calling a special endpoint (alias), for which you can configure one of the following authentication methods:
* GitHub Webhooks
* Token
* HMAC
* No authentication

The alias represents a URL in the following format: `/api/integrations/<random_string>`. Supports `GET` and `POST` requests.

## Matchers

With matchers, you can define parameters of the incoming request. When these parameters match, the template will be invoked.

## Value Extractors

With an extractor, you can extract the necessary data from the incoming request and pass it to the task as environment variables. For the extracted variables to be passed to the
task, you must create an environment with the corresponding keys. Ensure that the environment keys match the variables defined in the extractor, as this allows the task to receive
and use the correct environment variables.

## Task parameters

Integrations can trigger tasks with parameters. Use value extractors to build a JSON payload for task parameters and configure the template to accept prompted values.

## Notes on aliases and matchers

For integrations configured with an alias endpoint, matchers are not used. Prefer token/HMAC authentication as needed and pass parameters via extractors.
