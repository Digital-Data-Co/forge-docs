# Inventory

An Inventory is a file that contains a list of hosts Ansible will run plays against.
An Inventory also stores variables that can be used by playbooks. An Inventory can be stored in YAML, JSON, or TOML.
More information about Inventories can be found in the [Ansible Documentation.](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/inventory_guide/intro_inventory.html)

Forge UI can either read an Inventory from a file on the server that the Forge user has read access to, or a static Inventory that is edited via the web GUI.
Each Inventory also has at least one credential tied to it.
The user credential is required, and is what Ansible uses to log into hosts for that Inventory. Sudo credentials are used for escalating privileges on that host.
It is required to have a user credential that is either a username with a login, or SSH configured in the Key Store to create an Inventory.
Information about credentials can be found in the [Key Store](key-store.md) section of this site.
