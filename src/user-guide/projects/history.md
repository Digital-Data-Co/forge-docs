## Task Management

### Actions Available

From the history view, you can:

- Access complete task logs
- Download task output
- Search within logs

## Task Retention

Semaphore allows you to configure how long task history is retained:

1. **Default Behavior**
   - All tasks are stored in the database
   - No automatic deletion by default

2. **Configuring Retention**
   - Set maximum tasks per template
   - Configure via environment variable:
     ```bash
     SEMAPHORE_MAX_TASKS_PER_TEMPLATE=30
     ```
   - Or via config.json:
     ```json
     {
       "max_tasks_per_template": 30
     }
     ```

3. **Retention Rules**
   - When the limit is reached, oldest tasks are automatically deleted
   - Deletion is per template
   - Task logs are removed along with task records
<!-- 
## Best Practices

1. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Review and clean up old task history
   - Configure appropriate retention limits
   - Archive important task outputs if needed

2. **Monitoring**
   - Regularly check task success rates
   - Monitor task durations
   - Review error patterns

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - Use task history to identify patterns
   - Compare successful vs failed tasks
   - Track changes in task behavior

## Exporting History

You can export task history for:

1. **Audit Purposes**
   - Compliance requirements
   - Security reviews
   - Performance analysis

2. **Analysis**
   - Track task success rates
   - Monitor execution times
   - Identify patterns

3. **Backup**
   - Archive important task history
   - Maintain records for future reference

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**
   - Task history is subject to project permissions
   - Sensitive information in task output is protected
   - Access logs are maintained

2. **Data Protection**
   - Secure storage of task history
   - Proper cleanup of sensitive data
   - Compliance with data retention policies
