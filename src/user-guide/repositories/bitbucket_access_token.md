# Bitbucket Access Token

You can use a Bitbucket Access Token in Forge to access repositories from Bitbucket.

First, you need to create an Access Token for your Bitbucket repository with read access permissions.

After creation, you will see the access token. Copy it to your clipboard as it will be required for creating an **Access Key** in Forge.
