# Workspaces

Forge provides built-in support for Terraform workspaces, allowing you to manage multiple environments and configurations within a single project. This feature helps you maintain separate state files for different environments like development, staging, and production.

## Features

- **Workspace Management**: Create, switch, and delete workspaces directly from the Forge.
- **State Isolation**: Each workspace maintains its own state file, preventing conflicts between environments.
- **Environment Variables**: Configure workspace-specific environment variables.
- **Workspace Selection**: Choose the target workspace when running Terraform commands.

## Using Workspaces in Forge

### Creating a Workspace

In the **Workspaces** section of the Terraform/OpenTofu template where you want to add a workspace, follow these steps:

1. Click the ➕ button.  
2. In the menu that appears, select **New Workspace**.  
3. In the modal dialog, enter the workspace name and select the SSH key to be used for cloning modules.  
4. Click the **Create** button to add the new workspace to the template.  
5. You can now use this workspace to run tasks.
